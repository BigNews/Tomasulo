# Tomasulo

Teamwork. This repository is published along with a bunch of nonsense.

And I don't think this is the real Tomasulo.


Final project for the Computer Architecture course. After all, it's not a good CPU since it can only perform limited functionalities. It may be manufactured but it will lead the company directly to the bankrupcy as well.


Read the codes to find something interesting although these codes have nothing interesting.
